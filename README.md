## Introduction

In today's competitive landscape, understanding customer feedback is crucial for any business. This project aims to create a robust system for analyzing customer feedback through advanced data engineering techniques and NLP. By harnessing these technologies, we can provide actionable insights that drive improved customer satisfaction and strategic decisions.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a scalable SQL database schema for the efficient storage of customer feedback, implement NLP models to extract meaningful insights from the data, and integrate Azure Synapse and Power BI for interactive, real-time visualization of trends and sentiments.

## Goals

- **Develop a Scalable Database Schema:** Design an efficient SQL database schema that can handle large volumes of customer feedback data.
- **Implement NLP Models:** Utilize natural language processing techniques to extract sentiments and insights from the feedback data.
- **Integrate Visualization Tools:** Leverage Azure Synapse and Power BI for real-time visualization of feedback trends and customer sentiments.
